Air assist was added, on is low, off is high 6/3/2024 BW 
Tested frequency of PWM signal at 1khz and 5 khz, I was able to make changes in the firmware to adjust this.
Tested with g-code form Lightburn, it was working
Unsure of how M3 I and M4 I work
Using M3 I, I was able to get constant power working.  Verified with oscillscope
X-axis endstop worked
y-axis endstop worked
z-axis probe working
Use M43 I W to verify pin state.  Did this both in Lightburn and CNCJS
M9 an M8 control Air assist on and off
Stepper motor acceleration and other things need tuning. 
Next steps - verify bed mesh and probing
Add custom startup g-code to use bed mesh
